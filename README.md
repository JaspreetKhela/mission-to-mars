# Mission to Mars

## Overview
This repository contains code for a Flask application that scrapes websites for information on NASA's mars mission. Specifically, the application automates a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars; the retrieved data is stored in a NoSQL database and then rendered on a Flask webpage.

Note that the two additional Bootstrap attributes used here are:
* text-danger
* bg-danger
